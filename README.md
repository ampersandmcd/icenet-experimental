# icenet-experimental

A repository for the experimental development of IceNet, a deep learning based sea ice forecasting system.

This repository is, admittedly, a big mess! It's not supposed to be something cohesive or presentable, but rather a space for quick and dirty experimentation throughout my PhD. As I spin up projects and papers throughout my PhD, I will make new repositories with narrower scope and better documentation. For now, this exists to share snippets of code to collaborators and to keep me accountable for experimental progress!

In any case, I'm always happy to answer any questions and to discuss ideas via email to arm99 at cam dot ac dot uk.
